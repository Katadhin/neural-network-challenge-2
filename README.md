# Employee Attrition Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict employee attrition and department classification using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains various features related to employee demographics, job satisfaction, and work environment, along with the target variables: attrition (binary) and department (multi-class).

## Project Structure
- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Explore the dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature scaling.
- **Model Building**: Build neural network models using TensorFlow/Keras to predict employee attrition and department.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and visualize the results.
- **Improvement Strategies**: Discuss potential ways to improve the models and address any limitations.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided code)

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook files in the specified order:
    - `1_data_exploration_preprocessing.ipynb`
    - `2_model_building.ipynb`
    - `3_model_evaluation.ipynb`
4. Follow the instructions within each notebook to explore the data, build models, and evaluate their performance.
5. Modify the code as needed for further experimentation or customization.
